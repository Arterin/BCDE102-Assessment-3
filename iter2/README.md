The goal of iteration 2 is to have a node.js script read data about parties from a csv file and then to add those parties to an electorate. Then to print the electorate object into a .json file.

you can run the command: 'npm install' (without the single quotes) in the iter2 directory to install all the project's dependencies locally to the iter2 project folder. npm comes with node and you need to install node to run this project.

you can run iter2.js by entering into the terminal: node iter2.js
